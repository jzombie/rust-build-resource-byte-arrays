# build-resource-byte-arrays (Work in Progress)

`build-resource-byte-arrays` is a Rust crate that simplifies working with generated byte array resources during the build process of other crates.

It is intended to help avoid the complexity of relaying `OUT_DIR` from `build.rs` to the compilation step of consuming crates.
